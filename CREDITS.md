```scripts/remaster_iso_functions.sh``` was originally inspired by [linuxium-install-xenial-lts-kernel-4.10.0-10.12-16.04.2-linuxium.sh](https://linuxiumcomau.blogspot.com.au/2017/03/ubuntu-16042-and-ubuntu-1704-beta-1.ht) by [linuxium (Ian Morrison)](https://www.blogger.com/profile/16579769072594848618). However ```scripts/remaster_iso_functions.sh``` has now been completely rewritten from scratch. Ian Morrison has extended and improved his isorespin utility and the latest version can be found [on github here](https://github.com/linuxium/UbuntuLiveUSB).
